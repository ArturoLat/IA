# Intel·ligència Artificial - AI

This repository hosts a series of practical assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course, exploring various AI strategies and algorithms across different scenarios.

## [Practica 1: Chess Static King Checkmate](https://github.com/ArturoLat/IA/tree/main/Practica1)

The first practical assignment involves programming AI to checkmate a static black king using a white king and rook, applying basic search algorithms in a simulated chess environment.

## [Practica 2: Adversarial Game Search](https://github.com/ArturoLat/IA/tree/main/Practica2)

In Practica 2, we implement adversarial search algorithms, such as Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning, to strategize in a simulated chess game where both white and black sides have a king and a rook.

## [Practica 3: Q-learning in Deterministic and Stochastic Scenarios](https://github.com/ArturoLat/IA/tree/main/Practica3)

The third practical focuses on reinforcement learning through Q-learning. We apply the algorithm to both grid-based and chess scenarios, with tasks ranging from deterministic pathfinding to handling stochastic movements akin to a 'drunken sailor'.
